## What is a probability distribution?

A distribution, or more specifically, a probability distribution, is a mathematical function that links each value of a random variable with its probability of occurrence in the range of possible values (the so‐called sample space).

## What are the different types of distribution?

* Discrete distributions
  - Binomial
  - Poisson
  - Negative binomial
* Continous distributions
  - Normal or Gauss
  - Gamma
  - Beta

## What are quantiles and how do they divide data?

Quantiles are cut‐points that divide numeric observations into equally sized groups (subsets) of values when the data are sorted in ascending order. Hence, a quantile marks the boundary between two consecutive subsets. Likewise, they can also be interpreted as dividing a probability distribution into intervals of equal probability.

## What is the central limit theorem (CLT)?

The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means (not the raw data!), regardless of the distribution of the underlying population, approximates a normal distribution. The CLT further specifies that the average of the sample means (and standard deviations) will equal the population mean (and standard deviation). The CLT assumes independent, sufficiently large samples (n ≥ 30) of a random variable.

## What is the difference between Type I and Type II errors?

A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but we fail to accept it.

A type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but we fail to reject it. In other words, with a type II error, we incorrectly conclude that there is no effect/difference, even though it actually exists.
