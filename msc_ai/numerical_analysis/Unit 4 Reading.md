## Types of Sampling Methods (4.1)

Simple Learning Pro (2015) *Types of Sampling Methods (4.1)*. Available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTuj57uXWlk (Accessed: December 8, 2025).

* Biased samples
  - Convenience sample - only includes people who are easy to reach
	- Voluntary response sample - consists of people that have chosen to include themselves

* Unbiased sample
	- Simple random sampling
	- Stratified random sampling - devide the population into "strata" (group of similar people) and then sample from those strata.
	- Multistage sampling
