## What is the primary purpose of descriptive statistics, and how does it differ from other statistical methods?

Descriptive statistics is the simplest form of statistics: it is a tool to help people organize and summarize the inevitable variability in collections of actual observations or scores.

Descriptive statistics are often used in statistical modelling. A statistical model expresses the previous knowledge of the probability experiment that produced the observed data.

## According to the paper's analysis of housing prices in Beijing (Table 2), what were the key factors that contributed to the increase in housing prices between 2012 and 2015? Explain how the descriptive statistics helped identify these factors.

By comparing other variables such as the floor and orientations, the research group draws the conclusion that the average floor number is an indication of trending taller buildings because its increase corresponds to the increase in housing prices. In addition, since from the data, there are no significant changes in the orientation of the housing, the research group is able to conclude that housing orientation is not a determinant of the growth of housing prices.
    
Analysing the variables, from 102.523, 2.126, and 1.34, respectively, the average living space size, number of bedrooms, and living room count grew to 123.94, 2.415, and 1.559.

## Explain the difference between mean, median, and mode. Given the sample: 13, 15, 17, 15, 20, 15, 18, calculate all three measures of central tendency.

**Mean** is the arithmetic average of the sum of values in the data divided by the quantities of observations, which is one of the measures of central tendency.

`Mean = (13 + 15 + 17 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 18) / 7 = 16.1429`

**Median** is the value in the centre of the statistics arranged from either lowest to highest or vice versa [6]. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values; however, if the number of values is odd, the median is just the middle value.

`Ordered list: 13, 15, 15, 15, 17, 18, 20`

`Median = 15`

**Mode** is the observation that appears most frequently in the sample.

`Mode = 15`

## What are the main limitations of descriptive statistics as identified in the paper? Why is descriptive statistics alone not sufficient for comprehensive statistical analysis?

Even though descriptive statistics provide a summary of data, they are not enough for statistical analysis. For example, descriptive statistics cannot make any predictions about the future values of variables because it is unable to demonstrate trends. It can only be used to compare existing variables or the same variable in the past. The data collection process of descriptive statistics is also time consuming. For example, in section 4.1., to obtain the stock market data, the research group spends months collecting data from multiple sources.

## Based on Table 3 and Table 4 in the stock market analysis section, explain how descriptive statistics (particularly mean values) helped researchers determine the relationship between trust levels and stock market volatility during COVID-19.

In order to find out the relationship between volatility in the stock market and trust, using descriptive statistics, the research group performs a valuation of market volatility using univariate regression model analysis.

Based on the data from Table 4, even though from the mean values, there is not a big difference between the two countries' variables (high trust and low trust), the case growth rate of countries with high trust is positive 0.0420, while the case growth rate of countries with low trust is 0,0674, in which the latter is higher than the former, indicating that countries with high trust are more likely to have less stock market’s volatility.
