## Measures of location

* Mean - Average that describes the center of the frequency description.

* Mode - The number that occurs most frequently.

* Median - Middle number in a list of numbers that has been ordered - `(n + 1) / 2`

* 1st quartile - `(n + 1) * 1/4`

* 3rd quartile - `(n + 1) * 3/4`

## Measures of variability

* Range
    - Used in conjunction with the Median
    - Largest Value - smallest Value.

* Interquartile Range (IQR)
    - Used in conjunction with the Median
    - Range of the middle 50% of numbers in a distribution
    - 75th percentile - 25th percentile.

* Variance
    - Used in conjunction with the Mean.

* Standard Deviation;
    - Used in conjunction with the Mean.
    - Three-sigma rule
        - 68% of the observations within +/-1 SD of mean
        - 95% of the observations within +/-2 SD of mean
        - 99.7% of the observations within +/-3 SD of mean
