## Agentic Artificial Intelligence
##### Harnessing AI Agents to Reinvent Business, Work and Life
##### Pascal Bornet et al.

SPAR - Sense, plan, act, reflect.

ARM - Action, reasoning, and memory

Memory - Short term memory, long term memory, and feedback cycles

Short term memory - Context window, attention strategy, token management

Long term memory - Episodic memory, procedural memory, semantic memory

Agentic AI sweet spot - Impact, feasibility, effort (is it worth it? Not just cost, but rather whether the organisation is ready and can adapt)

The A.G.E.N.T. framework:
- Agent identity - Identity, role, scope
- Gear and brain - Tools, model and knowledge
- Execution and workflow - Error handling, circuit breakers, escalation to humans
- Navigation and rules - Filtering, prioritisation and decision logic (decision trails)
- Testing and trust - Common scenarios, edge cases, failure simulation

One tool one agent

Include important instructions towards the end of the prompt

Three stages of AI trust - Verification phase, calibrated trust, partnership

Decision autonomy - Strategic decision (human only), tactical decisions (AI recommendation, human approval), operational decisions (AI autonomous)

Leadership skills - AI literacy, hybrid team orchestration, ethical oversight, change management in the AI era (guiding team through the continuous evolution of AI capabilities and workplace integration)

Change-ready, AI-ready, human-ready

## Rethinking Consciousness
##### A Scientific Theory of Subjective Experience
##### Michael S.A. Graziano

Attention schema theory

Makes a good case for providing AI machines with "conscious"

Conscious, or mind, as information. Once engineers figure out a pragmatic way of copying the mind, humans can live forever in simulated world and explore the galaxy
